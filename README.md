## About

Modified from https://github.com/sclark39/UE-VR-Code-Sample/releases/tag/ue-4.16.2-template

I was disappointed that there was no C++ version of Unreal 4.20's VR template, so I decided to make one.

See Issues tab for info on the progress of these missing features. I do not have a Vive or PSVR, so they are untested. I am happy to accept pull requests for any issues found.
